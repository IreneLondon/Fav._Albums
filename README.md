# Fav_Albums
A database curated of my top 20 favorite albums. Queried data using JOIN,SUBQUERIES,AGGREGATIONS etc.
Here in the database I curated called Famous_people includes three tables; Singer, Info, and Album. 
The singer table contains the name of the artist, the Title of their latest album, and one Genre from the album.
The album table contained the album Id.
The Info table also contained the album Id, and release year of the album.
The main purpose was to query these tables using the JOIN, Subqueries, and REGEXP as well as perform some aggregations on the data
